Top-level folders
	People
	Places
	Tasks
	Things

We will start by putting items directly into folders.
User can easily create sublists and organize items within Lists within Folders
Moving items within a Folder is NOT byref, but you can reference an item BETWEEN Folders.

Probably need to ACS both Folders and Items in future
Need to add Account concept between Identities and Items (which can also partition on)
