            <h2>Welcome to Zaplify!</h2>
            <p>
                Zaplify is a new kind of item organizer.  While other folder applications merely help you track your to-do list, 
                Zaplify helps you complete your items by making valuable suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zaplify is a fully-functional "offline" application - meaning that it works great whether or not you have created 
                an account, and whether or not your phone happens to be connected to the Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, to get the most out of Zaplify, you will want to create a free account.  Here are some of the benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>All of your data will automatically be backed up in the Cloud</li>
                    <li>You can access your data from any device - your computer, a web browser, or your mobile device</li>
                    <li>You will enjoy Zaplify's unique capability of suggesting ways to complete your item</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To create your free account, go to the <i>Settings</i> page at any time by tapping the <i>settings</i> button.  
                Don't worry, unless you tell us otherwise, any data you've already created will automatically be sent to the Cloud for safekeeping.
            </p>
            <h2>Items</h2>
            <p>
                The main tab in the application is the <i>Items</i> tab.  This tab provides you a sorted list of all the items in all of 
                you folders.  You can filter this page by tapping the <i>filter</i> button.  You can also create new items in this tab by 
                tapping the <i>add</i> button.  Notice that the first thing you need to tell us is what list you want to add the item to.
                You can control which list this defaults in the <i>Settings</i> page.
            </p>
            <h2>Folders</h2>
            <p>
                Folders are a convenient way of organizing your items.  To view your folders, swipe to the <i>folders</i> tab.
                You may have noticed that we've already created two folders for you - <i>To Do</i> and <i>Shopping</i>.  
                You can add a new list by tapping the <i>add</i> button.  
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to change or delete any of the folders 
                (the ones added automatically or your own folders), you can tap the list name and then tap the <i>edit</i> button.  
                Once you've tapped a list name, you can see the items within that list.  Each of the tabs will sort by a different 
                field - by name, by due date, or by priority.  
            </p>
            <p>
                You can add new items from this page, either by tapping the <i>add</i>
                button, which will let you enter all of the fields of the item, or by tapping the <i>quick add</i> button, which 
                will allow you to rapidly create new items by entering just their name in the dialog and then tapping <i>add</i>.
                Once you're done, tap <i>done</i> to dismiss the dialog.
            </p>
            <h2>List Types</h2>
            <p>
                The two lists we've added each have a different list type - <i>To Do List</i> and <i>Shopping List</i>, respectively.  These two 
                list types have different styles - the <i>To Do List</i> has more fields that are displayed when you add or edit a item that belongs to 
                a list of this type.  The <i>Shopping List</i> has only a <i>Name</i> field and is more appropriate for simple items.  Finally, there
                is another built-in list type called <i>Freeform List</i> - this list type has a big <i>Details</i> field that allows entering 
                a free-form description, which can contain phone numbers, email addresses, websites, and so on.
            </p>
            <h2>Items and Actions</h2>
            <p>
                When you tap a item, you are placed on the Actions tab, which displays any quick actions associated with that item. 
                For example, if your item has a due date, the available actions are <i>Add to calendar</i> and <i>postpone to tomorrow</i>.
                If your item has a phone number, a website, or an email address, you will have the appropriate actions to <i>phone</i>, 
                <i>text</i>, <i>navigate</i>, or <i>email</i>.
            </p>
            <h2>Tags</h2>
            <p>
                Tags are a convenient way to associate a set of related items across lists.  You can have zero, one, or as many tags as you want 
                on a Item.  Just enter them in, separated by commas.  The <i>Tags</i> tab allows you to look at all your tags and bring up all the  
                items that have a particular tag.  Tags can also be color-coded to provide a better visual cue.  Just tap the tag name in the 
                <i>Tags</i> tab, and then tap the <i>edit</i> button.  You can also delete tags from this screen.
            </p>
            <h2>Advanced features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Templates:</b> You can designate a list as a template by tapping the list, tapping the <i>edit</i> button, and tapping the 
                <i>template</i> checkbox.  This list will now be available to import items from.  To import a template into a list, just tap the 
                <i>import from template</i> menu item in the list page.  </li>
                <li><b>Deleting all completed items:</b> You can delete all of the completed items in a list by tapping the <i>delete all completed items</i>
                menu item in the list page.</li>
                <li><b>Email data:</b> You can send a formatted copy of your data to any email address, so you can get your data out of the application 
                at any time.</li>
                <li><b>Sync now:</b> Zaplify will automatically sync your items, but you can trigger an immediate sync anytime by tapping the <i>sync now</i>
                button in the main page.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Go forth and be productive!</h2>
            <p>With that, have fun!</p>
